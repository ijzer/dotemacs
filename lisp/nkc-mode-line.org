#+TITLE: Mode Line

Sets up a dynamic mode line that takes into account the width of the
window to shorten and truncate things to display as much as possible
while remaining readable. The mode line is assembled by
[[https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline][spaceline]]. sml/do-shorten-directory from [[https://github.com/Malabarba/smart-mode-line][smart-mode-line]] truncates the
directory and file name as needed, applying rules from 

* Setup
** smart-mode-line
   [[https://github.com/Malabarba/smart-mode-line][github]]
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package smart-mode-line)
#+END_SRC
** powerline
   [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][github]]
* Modes
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (column-number-mode)
  (size-indication-mode)
#+END_SRC
* Mode line
  The mode line is separated in pieces mainly to make things easier to
  read. 
** Left
   The left side holds the ace-window indicator, the position info,
   buffer modified status, and buffer/filename
*** ace window
#+NAME: ace-mode-line
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (ace-window-display-mode
   (:eval
    (window-parameter (selected-window) 'ace-window-path)))
#+END_SRC
*** Positional indicators
    This obviously needs more formatting but I think I'll use
    powerline to do that.
#+NAME: pos-mode-line
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ("%3l" "%2c" "%6p" "of" "%I")
#+END_SRC
*** Buffer modification indicator
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC
